# Romania Housing App üè°
A simple Dash app to analyze housing data in Romania.  

Romania has the highest home ownership rate in the EU ([source](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/ILC_LVHO02__custom_3553007/bookmark/table?lang=en&bookmarkId=2457e44e-df35-4995-aacc-e79684402691)). üìà 

However, it is difficult to evaluate a property without any reference for comparison.
This is the motivation for creating this app. With it, users can select a region and 
compare how the **prices**, **net area** or **price per square meter** of a property compares to
the selection. As a result, users can make better informed decisions.

Area and price are good indicators to evaluate a property, but there are many other factors to take into account such as 
**year of construction**, **number of rooms** and **parking availability**. The input dataset
includes all this extra information for further analysis.

All data was extracted from posts on [homezz.ro](https://homezz.ro/).
